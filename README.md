Usage:
- Install MCUFRIEND library
- Load sketch into Arduino IDE and upload to your board with shield attached.

Next you can choose if you want to use PC USB ADC preset or ( named power bank ) USB external power ADC preset.
If none of these works for you, you can use calibrate option to calibrate one time your ADC.
If you want to permamently change calibration run calibration example from MCUFRIEND and copy paste results replacing values at the beginning of Paint.ino file.
